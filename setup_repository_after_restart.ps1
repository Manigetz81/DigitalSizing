Digital Sizing Measurement System - Initial Release

Major improvements to measurement accuracy:
- Fixed scale factor calculation using multiple reference methods
- Improved body proportion accuracy with realistic anatomical ratios
- Updated circumference conversion factors (2.6-2.8 vs œÄ)
- Enhanced measurement validation ranges for real-world values
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Created extensive test suite for measurement validation

Technical achievements:
- Scale factor: Multi-method calculation (shoulders/hips/image) with validation
- Circumference: Body-appropriate conversion factors instead of œÄ
- Proportions: Accurate head-to-body ratios (7.5:1 vs 8:1)
- Validation: Realistic ranges (height: 120-250cm, arm: 40-90cm)
- Error handling: Type conversion and detailed debug logging

Results: All measurements now consistently realistic across test images.
Example: shoulder width (40cm), chest circumference (95cm), arm length (63cm).

Ready for deployment and collaboration!
